# REFACTOR:
    - merge multiple solver classes methods into constructor to make a single deeper function

# TODO:
    - IMPORTANT: free nodes after each hierarchy insertation to database and measure performance.
    - IMPORTANT: refactor widget to use a tab per option (segment, link, track)
    - add warning when DB already contains data.
    - create homepage/docs.
        - document config
        - document database
    - option to lock segmentations from hypothesis viz widget

# NOTES:
    - heuristic optimizer:
        - add monte-carlo (probabilist) moves into local search function
        - local search by removing a node and trying to add its overlapping nodes

    - slurm:
        - segment: 1hr 30min, 790 jobs
        - link: 30min, 789 jobs
        - track 1st: 2hr 30min, 8 jobs of 100 time points + overlap
        - track 2nd: 2hr, 8 jobs of 100 time points + overlap
        - export: 20min
        - total: about 7 hours
        - NOTES:
            - fix window overlap sql solution update by adding parents only when it already exists on solution
            - segment step memory usage must be improved, with Daxi dataset it's using about 100GB per frame
            - tracks should be divided into smaller chunks
            - reduce tracking model build time with vector variables

# ARTICLE:
    - experiments comparing tracking results from essemble of connected components, watershed, cellpose, stardist vs their accuracy alone;
    - experiments comparing results from binary contour (their own algorithm post processing) vs contour obtained from network output directly;
    - cell-tracking challenge benchmark;
    - qualitative results our dataset and jan funke datasets;
