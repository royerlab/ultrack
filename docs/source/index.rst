``ultrack`` is general purpose 2D/3D cell tracking software.

It can track from segmentation masks or from raw images directly, specially fluorescence microscopy images.

Four interfaces are provided, depending on your needs:

- napari plugin
- FIJI plugin
- Python API
- Command line interface for batch processing, including distributed computing.

See below for additional details in each interface.


Moreover, it was originally developed to terabyte-scale zebrafish embryo images where we had few 3D annotations.
Hence, a few key features of ``ultrack`` are:

- Out-of-memory storage of intermediate results. You should not run out of memory even for large datasets. We have tracked a 3TB dataset on a laptop with 64GB of RAM.
- It does not commit to a single segmentation. Instead it considers multiple segmentations per cell and it picks the best segmentation for each cell at each time point while tracking.
