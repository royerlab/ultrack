## Gurobi setup

Installing gurobi and setting up an academic license.

### Install Gurobi using Conda

In your existing Conda environment, install Gurobi with the following command:

```bash
conda install -c gurobi gurobi
```

### Obtain and Activate an Academic License

**Obtain License:** register for an account using your academic email at [Gurobi's website](https://portal.gurobi.com/iam/login/).
