Large-scale cell tracking under segmentation uncertainty.

## Overview

Ultrack is a versatile and scalable cell tracking method designed to address the challenges of tracking cells across 2D, 3D, and multichannel timelapse recordings, especially in complex and crowded tissues where segmentation is often ambiguous. By evaluating multiple candidate segmentations and employing temporal consistency, Ultrack ensures robust performance under segmentation uncertainty. Ultrack's methodology is explained [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04526).

Zebrafish imaged using [DaXi](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01417-2) whole embryo tracking.

## Features

- **Versatile Cell Tracking:** Supports 2D, 3D, and multichannel datasets.
- **Robust Under Segmentation Uncertainty:** Evaluates multiple candidate segmentations.
- **High Performance:** Scales from small in vitro datasets to terabyte-scale developmental time-lapses.
- **Integration:** Compatible with FiJi, napari, and high-performance clusters via SLURM.

## Installation

Install or update [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

To avoid conflicts between different packages, we recommend using conda to create an isolated environment:

```bash
conda create --name tracking -c conda-forge python=3.10 pyqt
conda activate tracking
pip install ultrack
```

## Usage

**ATTENTION**: every time you need to run this software you'll have to activate this environment

```bash
conda activate tracking
```

Here is a basic example to get you started:

```python
import napari
from ultrack import MainConfig, Tracker

# __main__ is recommended to avoid multi-processing errors
if __name__ == "__main__":
      # Load your data
      foreground = ...
      contours = ...

      # Create config
      config = MainConfig()

      # Run tracking
      tracker = Tracker(config)
      tracker.track(foreground=foreground, edges=contours)

      # Visualize results in napari
      tracks, graph = tracker.to_tracks_layer()
      napari.view_tracks(tracks[["track_id", "t", "z", "y", "x"]], graph=graph)
      napari.run()
```

More usage examples can be found [here](examples), including their environment files and installation instructions.

## Gurobi Setup

### Install Gurobi using Conda

In your existing Conda environment, install Gurobi with the following command:
```bash
conda install -c gurobi gurobi
```

### Obtain and Activate an Academic License

1. Register at [Gurobi's website](https://portal.gurobi.com/iam/login/) with your academic email.
2. Navigate to the Gurobi's [named academic license page](https://www.gurobi.com/features/academic-named-user-license/)
3. Follow the instructions to get your license key.
4. Activate your license, In your Conda environment, run:

```bash
grbgetkey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
```

5. Replace YOUR_LICENSE_KEY with the key you received. Follow the prompts to complete activation.

### Verify Installation

Verify Gurobi's installation by running:
```bash
ultrack check_gurobi
```

Depending on the operating system, the gurobi library might be missing and you need to install it from [here](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-software).

## Who is using Ultrack?

Here is a list of projects and papers that are and have used ultrack:
- DaXi Project: Ultrack was used for tracking zebrafish embryos using high-resolution light-sheet microscopy as part of the DaXi project, demonstrating its capability to handle large-scale datasets efficiently. See paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01417-2).
- [Zebrahub.org](zebrahub.org) project: Ultrack is employed in projects hosted on ZebraHub.org to track and analyze zebrafish embryonic development. See preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.06.531398v2).
- Single-cell transcriptional dynamics in a living vertebrate: Ultrack was used for segmenting and tracking nuclei in light-sheet microscopy datasets of developing zebrafish embryos. See preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.03.574108v1).
